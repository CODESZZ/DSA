ðŸ”¹ Shallow Copy in Java (for Arrays)
-->A shallow copy copies only the reference of the array, not the actual data.
-->Both the original and copied arrays point to the same memory location.
-->Changes in one array reflect in the other.

ðŸ”¹ Deep Copy in Java (for Arrays)
-->A deep copy creates a new array and copies each element individually.
-->The new array is stored in a different memory location.
-->Changes in one array do not affect the other.
